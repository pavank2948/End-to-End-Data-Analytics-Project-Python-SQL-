# End-to-End-Data-Analytics-Project-Python-SQL-
Tools and Libraries Used
Python Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

zipfile: For extracting files from ZIP archives.

sqlalchemy: For connecting to and interacting with SQL Server.

Kaggle API: For downloading the dataset.

SQL Server: For storing the processed data.




Tools and Techniques Used
SQL Functions:

Aggregation functions (SUM, GROUP BY) for calculating totals.

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER) for ranking and partitioning data.

Conditional aggregation (CASE) for comparing data across years.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used to break down complex queries into manageable steps.




summary:
The project involved analyzing a retail orders dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset was preprocessed and transformed using Python (Pandas) to prepare it for analysis. The transformed data was then loaded into a SQL Server database for further analysis or storage. SQL functions such as aggregation (SUM, GROUP BY), window functions (ROW_NUMBER), conditional aggregation (CASE), and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were used to analyze and process the data. Tools like Pandas, zipfile, SQLAlchemy, and the Kaggle API were employed throughout the project.
